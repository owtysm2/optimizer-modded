`* - Translations with the asterisk didn't have a contributor provided in the original readme, but I went through the commits and attributed who I THINK had contributed. If there are any errors, please correct me!`

`Also, some attributions weren't present in the original hellzerg/optimizer repo at the time that I had forked this repo, so I added the respective thanks (also based on what I could read from the commit history)`
